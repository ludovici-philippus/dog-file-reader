<h2>About DOG</h2>
An extremely simple file reader coded on V lang
It is just a project to learn the V language, it is extremely fast and simple, the name Dog is just a kidding name because on Linux we read things with Cat.
<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>git clone https://github.com/ludovici-philippus/dog-file-reader/</li>
  <li>then enter into the folder: cd dog-file-reader</li>
  <li>and so, you can just type: ./install.sh as root, (don't forget to give this file permission to run with: chmod 111 ./install.sh) then the script will move the dog file to /usr/local/bin</li>
</ul>
